# Prompt-aided Cross-modal Graph Learning
This repository is Prompt-aided Cross-modal Graph Learning for subsurface defect segmentation in building facade inspection

This is the second part of the code for our paper: 
[Weakly-aligned Cross-modal Learning Framework for Subsurface Defect Segmentation on Building Facades Using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4845688) 
submitted to ***Automation in Construction***.

The code will be opened to the public after the publication of our paper.
